--  What happens if a script is deleted in Roblox?

-- Q: What happens if a script is deleted from a model in Roblox?

-- A: Deleting a script from a model can break its functionality. 
-- The model might not work as intended since the script controls its behavior and logic. 
-- Let's break down what happens when a script is removed.

-- 1. What role does the script play in a model?
-- Scripts define how a model behaves. Without a script, models lack logic and functionality.
-- Example: A model of a moving platform needs a script to control its movement.

-- 2. What happens when the script is deleted?
-- If the script is deleted, the model stops responding to game events, like player input.
-- It may no longer move, trigger animations, or react to players interacting with it.
-- Without a script, the model is just a static object in the game world.

-- 3. Models that depend on scripts
-- Some models are designed to function based on scripted behaviors.
-- Example: A door that opens when a player walks near it requires a script.
-- Without the script, the door remains closed and unresponsive.

-- 4. Can non-scripted models work without a script?
-- Yes, non-scripted models are just physical parts. They don’t require scripts to exist.
-- However, non-scripted models won’t have any dynamic behavior or interaction.

-- 5. Impact of script deletion on interactive models
-- Example 1: NPCs – NPCs use scripts to walk toward players or give quests.
-- Without a script, the NPC will stand still and won’t interact with the player.
-- Example 2: Interactive chests – A treasure chest relies on a script to open.
-- If the script is deleted, the chest won’t open when clicked.

-- 6. Dependencies on scripts
-- Models that perform complex behaviors (e.g., following players, triggering events) require scripts.
-- Deleting the script means the model can no longer perform those behaviors.

-- 7. How to recover functionality if the script is deleted?
-- You can recover the deleted script by either recreating it or restoring it from backups.
-- If a backup is unavailable, you can manually recreate the logic from scratch.

-- 8. Importance of scripts in game features
-- A script is the "brain" of interactive models and tools in Roblox games.
-- Without the script, models become just static visuals and lose their interactive purpose.

-- 9. Example of tool or game feature dependence
-- Example 3: A tool that allows players to interact with objects in the game requires scripts.
-- If the tool’s script is deleted, the tool no longer functions.

-- 10. Conclusion
-- In summary, deleting a script removes the functionality it provides.
-- Without scripts, models are limited to just static appearances with no logic or interaction.
-- Always back up your scripts and ensure they are intact for models to function properly.
